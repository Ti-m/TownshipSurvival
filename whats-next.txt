* DONE Stop production, if 3 produced items are in storage
* DONE Produce does not check if items are requirements are fulfilled
** DONE Requests items for production
*** DONE Add a new step in tick which scans production buildings and sets a request if production storage is empty and no request is pending

TestSetup
** Maybe use of Hilt is better?

Transport
** What happens if the route of an active transport is interrrupted
* Transport priorities are needed
* Ammu < Wood

Routing
* Sometimes buildings request items from a previos transport, then it flickers between two buildings
** Maybe ignore otuched here better? Or is it because it gets to a boundary where multiple paths have the same distance?
