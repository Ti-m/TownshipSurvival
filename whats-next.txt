Tasks - Open

The Gameloop needs some depth:
* DONE Add workers for buildings
** DONE Need luxurys like in Anno
** With housing like in Anno and upgradeable buildings
* DONE A house supports X persons
** DONE Each building needs a worker
** DONE They live in houses
** If a building is suspended, no space in a house is consumed
** DONE Houses get luxury's delivered
** A house can be upgraded if luxury resources are available
*** Takes 10 ticks
*** Needs to be activated actively by hand
** DONE A house consumes necessary luxury's every  50 Ticks
*** If not available, it is downgraded. This is instant
** Supports improved workers
*** Should the townhall support some level 1 workers?
*** lvl 1 House supports 2 Lvl 1 workers and 1 lvl 2 workers
*** Lvl 2 House supports 2 lvl 2 workers and 1 lvl 3 workers - Needs 1 Fish as luxury
*** Lvl 3 House supports 2 lvl 3 workers and 1 lvl 4 workers - Needs 1 Steak and 1 Goldring as luxury
Vielleicht hier die Zahlen noch ändern
Irgendwie wirkt Gold auch zu früh als Luxusgut

Statistics
* DONE Create a function, which calculates the housing demand for all buildings
** DONE Create a function, which counts buildings of a specific type
* DONE Create a function, which calculates the overall luxury demand for all houses
* Create a function which counts items in transport
* Create a function which counts items in storage
* Create a function which counts items in production

Housing

** Add "Fish outside ressources" in water
*** Fish is unlimited but can only be used by one fisher every round
*** (This concept can be adopted for ore in mountains)
* Implement upgrading of houses
* HousingOverlays: In the topleft/right should be a dismiss button overlay
* A house should show the different available Slot levels
* A production building should show which kind of housing slot it needs
* Remove animation for production progress in buildings when a worker is no longer available
* Add new building type for road, townhall? "OtherBuilding"?
* When a building is destroyed/ overbuild, there worker assignment is not cleared
* DONE Pause a house should remove the worker
** DONE The now empty slots are not reassigned, why?
* . House shall consume luxury's only if somebody is living there

* Housing
1 Buildable Houses
2 Contain lists of buildings which workers are housed
2.1 A data structure with references to the coordinates?
3 Need luxury resources. i.e. Food, Beer, Cloth ..

Bug
* DONE Scrollable region needs to be expanded to south. Because the app bar blocks some space

Refactor
* MapManager/ TransportManager does to much stuff
** Try to move some stuff down
*** DONE MapManager
*** TransportManager
* GameState Redesign Ideas:
** Currently it handles sideeffects of other actions.
*** I.E. If a destruction of a building is requested, it deletes all items associated

Infrasturucture

Graphics
Ideas: https://imgur.com/t/rts/swDzaNG
* DONE Add Animation infrastucture
** DONE Add 3 tick Explosion animation
** Make a nice flame/explosion icon
* Bug: Just after starting, the screen flickers, like reloading the app. Whats the issue here?
* Bug: View.generateViewId() creates error message "Invalid ID" in logcat, but seems to work anyway?

Combat
* Shooting animation tower
** red line in the path
** Get hit animation at zombie
** DONE Add ammunition for towers as new ressource which needs to be in production
*** 1 Dmg, later a dmg property?
*** Progressbar for reload (production)
** Buildings have Health
*** DONE 1 At the beginning
*** DONE Zombies explode when they reach a building dealing 1 dmg. So the Building is destroyed
**** DONE Add explosion animation
* Mobs dont attack buildings without resources delivered or in construction or finished

Map

Building
** Add an option to delete a building

Dialog

Production
* DONE Lumberjack
** guy moves to the tree and then the production starts? (later)
* Reduce townhall start resources to 2 Wood

TestSetup
** Maybe use of Hilt is better?

Transport

* Add a flag to buildings when a transport is started to a specific building. Prefer buildings where the transports is already in progress. to prevent rerouting of items.
* WONTFIX Currently only the stuff in front of the required queue is requested. I.e. pyramid: lumber+stone are requested. stone is only requested if all lumber is already there. This is hard to do, because touched is only set, after the GameState is applied. This is after the moveResource step.
* Transport is blocked if any field in the path is blocked. It should transport right before the next field
** What happens if the route of an active transport is interrrupted
* Transport priorities are needed
* Ammu < Wood

Routing
* Sometimes buildings request items from a previous transport, then it flickers between two buildings
** Maybe ignore touched here better? Or is it because it gets to a boundary where multiple paths have the same distance?
