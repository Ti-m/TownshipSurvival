Tasks - Done


*** DONE Implement the Routing in TransportManager
**** DONE Find pseudo code for A*, is optimized for arrays https://rosettacode.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Java . Does not work nice with my Lists
**** DONE Try A* with TestData
**** DONE Find variant with hexagons. Find out if its a worth read to build own algorithm with hexagons- https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
**** DONE Create a skeleton for the routing algorithm
**** DONE Implement get Neighbour Function
**** DONE A* Tutorial von ihm https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html -  Für den Anfang reicht https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#breadth-first-search
**** DONE Integration in TransportManager

*** DONE Improve CommandQuerySepartion at TransportManager
**** DONE Build specific tests for transportManager
**** DONE All interactions with cells should go through the GameState Objects
**** DONE Apply the new architecture of TransportManager to the project
**** DONE Apply the new architecture of MapManager to the project
**** DONE Create the routing algorithm


** DONE Refactor that the list operations are hidden by methods of a Manager class.
*** DONE Implement ExampleUnitTest.request the unit test to drive the design
**** DONE TransportManagerNew.createActiveTransports() needs to generate a route
**** DONE The current Test is a little wide. Build tests for MapManager
**** DONE Make the test work


* DONE Refactor BuilDialog
** DONE The fragmentManager should not be passed down
** DONE Handle the Request in independent class
** DONE Add UnitTests. See BuildDialogHandlerTest
* DONE Create a dependency diagramm out of the .jar with a tool
** DONE Automatisch geht nur mit der Intellij Ultimate Edition
** DONE Alternative ist PlantUML, hier kann man das UML Diagram von Hand schreiben.
** DONE Allerdings gibts es einen Code Generator nur für Java
** DONE Scrollable map
*** DONE Run on small phones to see if the scrollable map works
*** DONE ALternative is some grid system, which expands to a single cell on a bigger grid
**** DONE Works ok on Pixel 5 with 5" screen
* DONE Understand how to apply Next Action Approach by watching the video
** DONE Figure out what is the next single step. Decide based on that step what is the next
