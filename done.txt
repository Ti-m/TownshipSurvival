* DONE Only finished buildings do produce
* DONE Only construct, if building material is available
* Redo item storage spaces in buildings
** DONE Add storage list
** DONE Add requires list
** DONE Add production list
** DONE Add resource list
** DONE How to handle the search for an item:
*** DONE When it is searched for transport and storage, it has to be seperated between the GameState command to remove the object
* DONE Add Lumbermill building
** DONE Takes Wood and Produces Lumber
** DONE Jumps production? sometimes when wood is delivered it produces for two ticks
* DONE Disable a building
** DONE This will stop any resources being delivered.
** DONE Works for construction and production
** DONE Color cell Magenta if delivery is stopped
* DONE requiresProduction/requiresConstruction: MutableList<Resource> - Use an immutable list?
* DONE Construction shall consume the items for construction, at the beginning of construction
** DONE Add a fletcher which produces 1 arrow from 1 wood
** DONE Bug: Buildings are not constructing, if the are additional ressources in production.
*** DONE Example is the tower if an arrow is in front of the list
* DONE Add Building StoneMason, needs 2 Wood
** DONE Produces stone every 10 Ticks
** DONE Consumes WorldResource Rock
* DONE Monument
** DONE Add Build Pyramids for 100 Wood
* DONE Add Forester
** DONE Production, plants a tree every 10 ticks
*** DONE Add some random where is planted?
*** DONE Trees are planted in the water currently
* DONE Add ShuffledRandomNeighbour to FindWorldResource

Production
* DONE Lumberjack Produce wood every 10 ticks

Graphics
* DONE Replace single color backgrounds with simple images
** DONE Learn how to draw pixelart in Gimp?
*** DONE How many pixels needs the png to fill a hexagon. seems like less then 20px*20px
*** DONE How to draw a drawable which is not square

** DONE Or draw it straight in android studio with paths?
** DONE Add building in construction graphic
** DONE Always print text on top of building graphics
** DONE Add trees to some green fields
** DONE Add cacteen to some yellow fields
** DONE Add road connection graphics
** DONE Add algorithm to determine the road connections

** DONE The graphics of the diagonal roads are not fitting together
*** DONE Redraw neighbour roads on building new roads
* DONE Two Step graphics: One idea to create some life in the graphics is to animate them
** DONECreate a slightly different second picture which alternates every second
** DONE Fletcher
** DONE Stonemason

**DONE Wood
**DONE Lumber
**DONE Stone
**DONE Arrow
*DONE Add ground graphics
* DONE Allow animated graphics.
** DONE If automatic RunLoop is activated, there should be an in between steps between all steps. In this steps, only in between graphics are drawn
DONE 1 - 0ms
DONE 2 - 1000ms
* DONE Lumberjack
** DONE Only Produces if tree (resource) is in range
** DONE Production will consume a tree
** DONE The production limit is not used, lumberjack produces until full
* DONE Stop production, if 3 produced items are in storage
* DONE Produce does not check if items are requirements are fulfilled
** DONE Requests items for production
*** DONE Add a new step in tick which scans production buildings and sets a request if production storage is empty and no request is pending
*** DONE if building is finished
*** DONE only request stuff for the next production, not two more
** DONE Remove items at the start of production

Combat
* DONE Tower only requests arrows, if its empty. The requesting can be updated after each shot
* DONE Set a spawner every 200 ticks
** DONE Remove initial spawner
** DONE Tower shoots arrows <--
***DONE Tower should have up to 3 Arrows
*** DONE Request arrows for 'production'
**** DONE Bug: Arrow disappears, after dilivery into tower
*** DONE Add range property
**** DONE Find a Target within range.
**** DONE Every tower searches its surrounding each tick for a valid target
*** DONE The tower will shoot an arrow in a straight line at a zombie within range
**** DONE This is a one tick action, but show an animation at the full shooting path
* DONE Zombies spawner in SE map border. Created with Townhall
* DONE Spawn a Zombie every 100 Ticks (Production)
** DONE Add Zombie graphics
** DONE Zombies move 1 tile per tick
*** DONE Zombies ignore Roads and spawners
** DONE At the moment the old zombies are not deleted in a proper way. so the zombies are blurred over the map

Map
** DONE Show construction progress
** DONE Show Production progress

Transport
* DONE: A single cell shall transport only a single item each round
** DONE The transport system ignores how many things are already on a field. So if lumberjack requests
    3 items of wood it crashes
* DONETransport only on roads
* DONE First allow any building, instead of only roads
* DONE Generalize the Commands?
* DONE MoveTransports
** DONE always recalc each route at the beginning of a tick?
** DONE This will bypass obstacles
** DONE This will remove the dependency loop ..
** DONE This needs to loop through all cells to find requests..
* DONE convertStorageToProduction
** DONE Convert an item from the storage list to the production list. This makes the item unavailable
   for further transports. This removes the item from the request list.
** DONECrash when a transport is finished should be fixed then
* DONE Improve coordinate grid
** DONE Das Zeichnen der Hexes fixen. Ist das GameWold?
** DONE Test für MapGenerator bauen - wie createMap sinnvoll aufsplitten. Ist MapGeneratorTest der richtige Weg?
** DONE Double Coordinates Koordinatensystem benutzen
** DONE Eine Hashmap anstelle von einer Liste benutzen? https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#map-storage
** DONE Beim Transport kommt: java.util.NoSuchElementException: Key Coordinates(x=12, y=7) is missing in the map.
** DONE The Transportation tests fails. but in the real app it works
** DONE Try to remove the coords from Cell/Flagtile. Seems not to work. Build dialog handler needs it
*** DONE Implement the Routing in TransportManager
**** DONE Find pseudo code for A*, is optimized for arrays https://rosettacode.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Java . Does not work nice with my Lists
**** DONE Try A* with TestData
**** DONE Find variant with hexagons. Find out if its a worth read to build own algorithm with hexagons- https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
**** DONE Create a skeleton for the routing algorithm
**** DONE Implement get Neighbour Function
**** DONE A* Tutorial von ihm https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html -  Für den Anfang reicht https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#breadth-first-search
**** DONE Integration in TransportManager
*** DONE Improve CommandQuerySepartion at TransportManager
**** DONE Build specific tests for transportManager
**** DONE All interactions with cells should go through the GameState Objects
**** DONE Apply the new architecture of TransportManager to the project
**** DONE Apply the new architecture of MapManager to the project
**** DONE Create the routing algorithm

Dialog
* DONE A Dialog is needed to query the state of a cell
* DONE What is in storage
* DONE What is requested
* DONE Production progress
* DONE Show Building progress
** DONE The fragmentManager should not be passed down
** DONE Handle the Request in independent class
** DONE Add UnitTests. See BuildDialogHandlerTest
* DONE Create a dependency diagramm out of the .jar with a tool
** DONE Automatisch geht nur mit der Intellij Ultimate Edition
** DONE Alternative ist PlantUML, hier kann man das UML Diagram von Hand schreiben.
** DONE Allerdings gibts es einen Code Generator nur für Java
** DONE Scrollable map
*** DONE Run on small phones to see if the scrollable map works
*** DONE ALternative is some grid system, which expands to a single cell on a bigger grid
**** DONE Works ok on Pixel 5 with 5" screen
* DONE Understand how to apply Next Action Approach by watching the video
** DONE Figure out what is the next single step. Decide based on that step what is the next

Routing
* DONE Block cells which already applied submitted Gamestate objects for further changes. This helps in many cases
** DONE Is this really possible? Works bad with the granular states. The Game States cannot be atomic then
** DONE Better to run the transports not in a loop. apply each Transport before calculating the next
** DONE BUt how to make sure, that a single item is not moved twice a round
** DONE Block the move ressources for a round. Add a touched property for destinationcell
** DONE Add circular search for items for transport, starting at the destination
*** DONE Atm this blocks the transport
*** DONE Add Tests getNeighboursOfCellDoubleCoords
*** DONE Refactor getNeighboursOfCellDoubleCoords
*** DONE Add tests calcRouteToItemInTransport/calcRouteToItemInStorage
*** DONE Refactor calcRouteToItemInTransport/calcRouteToItemInStorage
*** DONE Add tests handleRequests
*** DONE Refactor handleRequests
*** DONE Bug: Sometimes and item will be jumping around between two destinations
**** DONE Build a mechanism to init the gameworld to a specific state. It should not be necessary to recreate it fpr every test
**** DONE Add a test in Transportation for this case?
** DONE Add Step move from storage to transport in place
* DONE Only allow setting of one item each round at a cell?
* DONE Only allow transports on roads
** DONE calcRoute_RoadMissing
** DONE Atm any type of building is allowed, refactor to only allow roads, but at any building at start or destiantion

UI
* DONE Remove Title Bar
* DONE Inflate layout, then add Zoominglayout in code
* DONE Add PAuse button
* DONE Disable automatic gameloop if pause pressed
** DONE Add singlestep button

Statistics

Housing
* DONE Add Housing Buildings with demand
** DONE Add HouseLvl1
** DONE Add HouseLvl2
** DONE Add HouseLvl3
* DONE If a house is idle (no luxurys) then don't Allow use of it's spaces
** DONE Buildings need a "Worker assigned" Boolean
** DONE A house should know where it's inhabitans work
** DONE A production building should know where it's workers live
** DONE Add a function which resets worker assigned
** DONE Add a function which assigns workers to houses
** DONE Function to query available housing
** DONE Show overlay color, if a building has no worker
* DONE Add a property which specifies the available space.
** DONE Add a building derivied type "House"
*** DONE all buildings are derived from "House"
* DONE Add a new section in game loop
* DONE Before production. Search for all *houses* without a running production
** DONE For each one found, check if resources available
** DONE if one is found without, then remove workers from production buildings
** DONE Before production, check if worker is assigned
* DONE Add Houses to Build Dialogs
* DONE Add Fisher
* DONE Show in inspect dialog, where a worker of a house lives
** DONE Show an overlay on the world map after looking into a house.
** DONE This should color the building and the corresponding house where the worker lives
** DONE Different colors?
* DONE In GameStateManager, add a concept like getCellsWithHousesAndARunningProductionAndEmptySpacesAvailable
** DONE To give new buildings a slot in a house until the next luxury is consumed. Otherwise, only in this case a new house would be assigned.
* DONE Buildings consuming world resources, are producing without worker. I.e. lumberjack
** DONE Spawner should produce without a worker. Currently it does not work???
** DONE Does arrow shooting already require a worker? No
* DONE Production is not increased in houses
** WONTFIX/HARDTODO Refactor the "is Spawner" and "is House" checks and use polymorphism. This check can be replaced with the new ProductionBuilding/Spawner Types
* DONE A house gets more workers assigned then slots available
